# FoliFind
The plant identification app.

## What is it?
FoliFind is a personal project I'm currently working on. The goal is to create an app that allows users to identify plants by scanning it with their phone camera. Upon a successful scan of a plant, the user will be given basic info, with the option to view more advanced information. Additionally they'll be able to save plants to their "Greenhouse" where they can access the info at a later time.

## Future Plans
 Some features I've considered to add in the future:
- Care recommendations
- Plant disease identification
- Plant suggestions
  - Given a location or other plants already planted, provide suggestions of compatable plants.
